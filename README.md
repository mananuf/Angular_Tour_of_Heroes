# TourOfHeroes

This Tour of Heroes tutorial provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Angular and shows you how to:

- Set up your local Angular development environment.
- Use the Angular CLI to develop an application

The Tour of Heroes application that you build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The application has many of the features that you'd expect to find in any data-driven application.

The finished application:

- Gets a list of heroes
- Displays the heroes in a list
- Edits a selected hero's details
- Navigates between different views of heroic data
